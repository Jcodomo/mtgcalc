# Changelog

## 2026-10-02 - Release 55.2 layout pass

- Made the application and suite headers opaque and stable so content does not show through while scrolling.

- Kept all inputs, menus, navigation, calculations, and live-summary behavior unchanged.

## 2026-10-02 - Release 55.1 performance pass

- Added a shared rendering pass to all eight entry points to prevent horizontal reflow, reserve scrollbar space, and reduce animation-driven scroll judder.

- Retained all Release 55 features, direct routes, and compatibility aliases.
